      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // const team = players;

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // team[2] = 'nigga';

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = "niggaboi";

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[3] = "gayboi";

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "goonmaster";

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 21;
      // captain.age = 69;

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 69 });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const sab = {
        name: "James",
        age: 19,

          facebook: "James Sabio",
          instagram: "@sab1of1",
        },
      };

      console.clear();
      console.log(sab);

      const dev = Object.assign({}, sab);
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(sab)); // you turn it into a string first to make a copy and then immediately turn it back into object
